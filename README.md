# Multi-modal wireless sensor network (WSN) enabled smart earbuds for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
A multi-modal wireless sensor network (WSN) automatically controlled music therapeutic device was
engineered to alleviate discomfort, agitation, and pain from sensory overload from overstimulation of
one or more of the body's five senses. 60-96% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
exhibit sensory abnormalities, resulting in lower thresholds for loudness discomfort levels (LDLs) that
cause sensory overload. The engineered device takes in three biometric sensor inputs — heart rate,
skin humidity, and skin temperature and one environmental sensor input — noise level. When
biometric signals indicate an agitated state or environmental noise inputs exceeding 80 dB HL — the
LDL shown for individuals with sensory abnormalities — the prototype automatically triggers music
playing to provide music therapy, which has been shown to relieve sensory overload and improve
social communication in individuals with ASD. Prototype development was conducted in three
phases of experimentation: controlled proof of concept, end-to-end proof of concept, and real-world
scenario simulation. One machine learning (ML) model and three algorithmically-controlled models
were compared to test the accuracy of the models. The percentage change algorithm was
determined to be the most accurate model based on Fisher's Exact Test with p=0.813. The
implications of the study demonstrate the viability of an automatically triggered earbud based on
biometric and environmental signals collected by a WSN to alleviate discomforts from auditory
sensitivity. Future studies will conduct user testing with both individuals with ASD and control groups
to develop personalized ML models to accommodate varied biometric baselines and reactions to
agitation.
